# Ding Dong Micro Hack

## The problem
Getting into the building for some Nola tech meetups can be difficult after 6pm. Currently, folks just ping on Slack and hope someone sees the message to let them in. It would be great if there was a bright, physical signal for all to see when someone is waiting outside.

The hack is called Ding Dong because we basically just want to make a (visual) doorbell üõéÔ∏è.

## Our goal
Our goal is use an Arduino compatible microcontroller ([NodeMCU 1.0 - ESP-12E Module](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/boards/espressif8266/nodemcuv2.html)) and [Arduino Cloud](https://app.arduino.cc/) to create a remote controlled light switch. We've broken down this process into six milestones.

*  [Milestone 1](./docs/milestones/1-MILESTONE.md) - 'Hello world' for the MCU board
*  [Milestone 2](./docs/milestones/2-MILESTONE.md) - Create a virtual button that controls a variable
*  [Milestone 3](./docs/milestones/3-MILESTONE.md) - Use the virtual button to toggle an LED
*  [Milestone 4](./docs/milestones/4-MILESTONE.md) - Add a relay to your circuit
*  [Milestone 5](./docs/milestones/5-MILESTONE.md) - Add a light source to your circuit
*  [Milestone 6](./docs/milestones/6-MILESTONE.md) - Add whatever you want
