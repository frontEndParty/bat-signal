# Ding Dong Micro Hack

## Our goal
##### Our goal is use an Arduino compatible microcontroller (we'll be using the NodeMCU 1.0 - ESP-12E Module) and Arduino Cloud to create a remote controlled light switch. We've broken down this process into six milestones.

## Table of Contents:
* [PREREQUISITES](./docs/PREREQUISITES.md) - Terms and concepts we'll be using

*  [Milestone 1](./docs/milestones/1-MILESTONE.md) - Setup a 'Hello world' with your MCU board
*  [Milestone 2](./docs/milestones/2-MILESTONE.md) - Create a virtual button that controls a variable
*  [Milestone 3](./docs/milestones/3-MILESTONE.md) - Use the virtual button to toggle an LED
*  [Milestone 4](./docs/milestones/4-MILESTONE.md) - Add a relay to your circuit
*  [Milestone 5](./docs/milestones/5-MILESTONE.md) - Add a light source to your circuit
*  [Milestone 6](./docs/milestones/6-MILESTONE.md) - Add whatever you want
