## MILESTONE FIVE
**GOAL: PARTY**

Now you get to add some extra functionality to your board. This step is open ended, but here are some examples of what you can do to get you started.

* Create a User Interface
* Use leds to indicate status
* Use a button to reset the board
* Use a button to send feedback to the ding dong user


 Have fun!
